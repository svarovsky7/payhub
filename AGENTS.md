# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
PayHub is a Vite + React + TypeScript app. `src/` holds all client code; features live in scoped folders (e.g., `src/pages/InvoicesPage.tsx`). `src/main.tsx` just wires providers and must stay slim. Shared assets go in `src/assets/`; static files that ship verbatim live in `public/`. Supabase SQL and metadata sit in `supabase/`. Keep experiments out of `dist/`, which is generated. Place new tests alongside components as `Component.test.tsx` once Vitest lands.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` syncs dependencies after lockfile changes.
- `npm run dev` launches Vite on `http://localhost:5173` for live reload.
- `npm run build` runs `tsc -b` then emits production assets to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the built bundle for smoke checks.
- `npm run lint` executes ESLint across `.ts/.tsx`; fix or justify warnings before PR.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use function components with PascalCase filenames (`PaymentPanel.tsx`), hooks/utilities in camelCase (`useInvoices.ts`). Stick to 2-space indentation, single quotes, and trailing commas. Order imports: external packages, absolute aliases, then relatives. Keep styles near components in `.css` files and namespace selectors (`ph-dashboard__header`).  All user-facing copy must stay in Russian (ru-RU); do not introduce other locales without explicit approval.

## Testing Guidelines
Vitest plus React Testing Library are the planned stack; do not add alternative frameworks. Follow `Component.test.tsx` naming. Until tests exist, document manual verification in PRs (flows, edge cases). Target ?80% coverage for core flows once the suite is configured.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Store environment secrets in `.env`. Supabase credentials live under `VITE_` prefixesï¿½never log them. Keep `supabase/ai_context` files authoritative for schema info; avoid ad-hoc SQL outside migrations.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Adopt Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). Keep commits focused and buildable. PRs need a clear summary, linked ticket, manual test notes, and UI captures when visuals change. Surface deployment risks and follow-up tasks so the roadmap stays transparent.
